## **_(Management Aid for Disaster Relief Assistance Teams)_**

Every year, there are several incidents of disasters striking across the country. These incidents cause untold emotional suffering in addition to loss of property and life. A significant amount of hardship can be alleviated through efficient information dissemination and resource management.

The disaster management strategy involves the use of web and mobile applications, print and electronic media, SMS, etc., along with on the ground personnel for making the best use of information and resources available. But this doesn’t seem to be working efficiently as seen during the recent natural disasters. People rely on popular apps and internet forums to share information and seek or provide help. Even this method of sharing information is very unreliable as its dependent on internet connectivity to work effectively.

**MADAT _(Management Aid for Disaster Relief Assistance Teams)_** is proposed as an information management aid which addresses some  crucial gaps mentioned above. As part of the MADAT application the following features will be introduced:
1. Alerts and Warnings sent to people in the affected areas (through **SMS**) before a disaster strikes.
2. Important Updates broadcast through SMS during and after the disaster.
3. Use of **USSD _(Unstructured Supplementary Service Data)_** menu driven application to provide users with a means to do the following:
- Report an incident   
- Offer Assistance
- Request Assistance
- Find the nearest assistance centre for shelter, food, medical aid, etc,.
- Track the status of requests

The above features will require no internet connectivity. Through the use of USSD, a significant amount of cost involved in communication will be reduced. As this doesn’t involve use of a mobile app, a greater number of people especially those who don’t have smart phones can be reached.

For disaster relief teams, the MADAT application will have a web application providing the following features:
1. Create message broadcasts for alerts and updates.
2. Track and manage resources like food, shelter, medical aid and personnel.
3. Create and manage information which will be used by the menu driven USSD app.
4. Track and manage requests and offers of assistance.

Since the disaster management teams will be in locations with better internet connectivity, the web application will prove useful in management of information and resources. In the areas affected by the disaster **_the use of SMS and USSD text will help people track and share information, resources, etc., even with limited mobile connectivity and zero internet connectivity using a basic mobile handset_**.
